## Requirements

- Step 1: Choose Data Model
Since you prefer JSON, we can opt for a document-oriented model similar to MongoDB, but with our 
custom implementation and query language.

- Step 2: Custom Query Language
I will Implement a custom query language that supports natural language processing. For instance, 
users can type "find books with more than 200 pages" and the system will interpret and execute this 
query. We can achieve this using a combination of predefined templates and NLP libraries to parse 
and interpret the queries.

- Step 3: Data Storage
The data will be stored in JSON format, and we will implement a chunking mechanism to handle large 
datasets. Each chunk will be a separate file to ensure we're not loading the entire dataset into 
memory.

- Step 4: CLI (Command Line Interface)
Will implement a CLI for interacting with the database. Use a prompt toolkit or similar library to 
facilitate this.

- Step 5: Query Execution
I will Implement functions to execute queries - including filtering, projection, join, grouping, 
aggregation, and ordering
